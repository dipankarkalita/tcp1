# Traffic Control Strategies

TCP Pro offers customized temporary traffic control plans to suit various needs. We've outlined the most common types of plans, which cover a wide range of traffic control scenarios. This resource can also help you identify the necessary traffic control measures for your specific project.

## Detour Plan

We identify the need, assess the road network, determine route options, evaluate feasibility, select the preferred route, design the plan, coordinate with stakeholders, communicate the plan, implement and monitor it.

## Alley Closure

When alley closures are required we follow a standard process, including notifying those impacted, displaying clear signs, setting up barriers, creating a detour plan, collaborating with emergency services, and overseeing and enforcing the closure.

## Parking Lane Closure

We implement parking lane closures through a multi-step process that includes notification, signage, barricades, alternative parking, traffic management, stakeholder collaboration, and enforcement.

## Sidewalk Closure

When construction occurs on sidewalks or in park areas, we implement sidewalk closures by notifying affected parties, posting clear signage, installing barricades, providing alternative pedestrian routes, coordinating with stakeholders, and monitoring and enforcing the closure.

## Single Lane Closure

When a single lane closure is required, whether it's the left, right, or center lane, we follow standard procedures. To safely redirect traffic, we utilize flashing arrow boards to guide vehicles from the closed lane to an adjacent lane. For highway closures, we take additional precautions to ensure safety.

## Double Lane Closure

During a double lane closure, we follow similar steps to those taken during a single lane closure and implement additional measures such as utilizing double flash lighting arrow boards and developing traffic management plans to minimize congestion and delays.

## Lane Shift and Merge

During construction, if one or two lanes are closed, we redirect traffic to an adjacent lane by following city standards outlined in relevant manuals, such as the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), in addition to our standard procedure.

## Flagger

We prioritize using flaggers alongside standard procedures in scenarios such as construction at intersections, single-lane two-way traffic, areas with high pedestrian or bicycle activity near work zones, locations where work zones restrict drivers' visibility or ability to navigate safely, and on highways or busy roads where additional guidance is necessary for driver safety.
